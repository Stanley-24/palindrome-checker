# Palindrome Checker

## Description
The **Palindrome Checker** is a simple web app that allows users to check if a word or sentence is a palindrome. 
A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

ðŸ’¡ A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

This project was created as part of my learning journey in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The app checks various inputs, handles edge cases, and informs the user whether the input is a palindrome or not.

## User Stories
- You can enter any text in the input field.
- Click the "Check" button to check if the input is a palindrome.
- If the input is empty, you'll get an alert to "Please input a value."
- The result will display whether the input is a palindrome or not.
